#  Marketing Analytics: Customer Segmentation

This project is a part of my **Data Analytics Internship at Oasis Infobyte (OIBSIP)**. The objective is to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify customer segments for targeted marketing strategies.

#  Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a powerful strategy used in marketing analytics to categorize customers based on various characteristics. This helps businesses understand their audience better and optimize marketing campaigns.

In this notebook, I performed **K-Means Clustering** on customer data to identify distinct groups based on behavior and spending patterns.

#  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (KMeans)
- Jupyter Notebook

# Key Steps

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Initial inspection of customer attributes
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Standardizing features
3. **Visualization**
   - Pair plots, scatter plots, elbow method
4. **Customer Segmentation**
   - K-Means clustering with optimal `k`
5. **Insights**
   - Interpreting each customer group to derive business actions

---
# Results
The clustering model successfully segmented customers into **[number]** distinct groups based on features such as:

- Annual income
- Spending score
- Age
- Gender (if included)

Each segment provides actionable insights for personalized marketing strategies.
